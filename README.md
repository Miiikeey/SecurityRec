# SecurityRec

What is your security recommendation? Why did you choose it?
-	We chose Authentication, as we wanted to have a personalized account for everyone using the application. This will provide a suitable environment for individuals as they want their own playlists and settings. This will also provide a safe information holder and safe backup, as no one will have access to accounts other than the user.
Who does the recommendation benefit (end-user, developer, etc.)?
-	It will uphold a basic security for users to keep their accounts and also provide an extra layer of authentication. It will be easy to provide recommendations in the app as accounts are specialized and unique. It lets users keep credentials with security and create their own sessions.

When would the recommendation have to be implemented (based on how serious the security risk is)?
-	The recommendation is ultimately needed from the start as the app is not functional for account usage. People will need to create an account to create playlists or even like songs. We will also need authentication for payment of subcriptions thus making it more severe of the risk.

Why do you think your project needs your recommendation?
-	It needs it because it’s the foundation of the application, with out authentication accounts will not be made and so are payments.
How do you think your recommendation could be applied?
-	It could be applied by creating 2FA with 3rd parties, such as google authentication.
How feasible would the implementation be?
-	It should be simple as we can use API’s to help with the functionality and connectivity
